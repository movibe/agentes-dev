# Dark Theme Implementation

## Overview

The dark theme was implemented using next-themes in conjunction with Tailwind CSS, providing a consistent and pleasant visual experience in both light and dark modes.

## Technologies Used

- **next-themes**: For theme management
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with dark mode support
- **Heroicons**: For theme toggle icons

## Created Components

### 1. ThemeToggle

- Location: `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`
- Features:
  - Toggles between light and dark themes
  - Contextual icons (sun/moon)
  - Visual interaction feedback
  - System theme support

### 2. ThemeProvider

- Location: `src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- Settings:
  - 'class' attribute for Tailwind
  - Default theme: system
  - System theme support
  - Disabled transitions on theme change

## Tailwind Configuration

```js
darkMode: 'class',
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: {
        // Custom color scale
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Component Implementation

### Header

- Adaptive colors for text and background
- Smooth theme transitions
- Adequate contrast in both modes

### Sidebar

- Adaptive background and borders
- Adjusted text and icon colors
- Consistent hover and focus states

### Cards

- Adaptive shadows and backgrounds
- Adjusted text and badge colors
- Maintains readability in both themes

## Implemented Best Practices

1. **Accessibility**

   - Adequate contrast in both themes
   - Aria-labels on theme button
   - Visible focus on interactive elements

2. **Performance**

   - Disabled transitions on theme change
   - Optimized icon loading
   - Prevention of incorrect theme flash

3. **UX**
   - User preference persistence
   - System preference respect
   - Visual interaction feedback

## Future Improvements

1. Add theme transition animations
2. Implement custom themes
3. Add theme selection preview
4. Improve transition visual feedback
